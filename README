  so this is my first game ever. i drew the background myself. the other images, i took them from the internet.
  
  controls are pretty basic:
  
    - press right and left arrow keys to control the spaceship.
    - press spacebar to shoot the enemies
    
  i know it is a pretty simple game and its not much but it is much to me. 
  it was fun creating it, it was fun playing it. i really enjoyed the procces
